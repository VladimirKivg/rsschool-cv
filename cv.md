## I enjoy programming because it's both fascinating and interesting. Although I have a main job, programming is my hobby. I've completed several training projects and now I'm eager to contribute to a real JavaScript project. My goal is to master pure JavaScript and learn the React library. I'm excited to join in the development of open-source projects and would love to work under the guidance of an experienced developer to gain practical experience.
### java , javascript, typescript, PHP, scram, solid spring ...
 ```javascript
 function flipNumber(n){
const length = n.length;
let str = '';
n=n.split('')
for(let i=0;i<length;i++){
n=n.reverse();
str+=n.shift()
}
return str;
}

```
